Article Structure
- The Problem: Apartment dwellers face restrictions on permanent modifications like painting, flooring, or lighting fixtures.
- The Solution: Leverage portable hardware like Raspberry Pis and "plug-and-play" smart devices that can be managed through a Dockerized Home Assistant instance.
- Key Focus: Use tools like Tailscale for secure remote access without port forwarding and automate lighting or cat-related needs (like cameras and music for Chirp) through software rather than structural changes.
- The Value: Create a "refined" and professional living space that feels high-tech and customized without risking a security deposit.
